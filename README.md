# ViscAL

Github repository associated with the manuscript "Combining High Throughput Experiments and Active Learning to Characterize Deep Eutectic Solvents".

# Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:
  - Databases (contains csv files for all datasets used)
  - Python (contains the Python scripts developed in this work)

Each Python script can be run independently. Thorough documentation is included inside each Python file, including instructions on how to run the code.
